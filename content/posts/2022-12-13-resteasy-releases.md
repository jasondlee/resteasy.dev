The time has come for two new RESTEasy releases; [6.2.2.Final](/downloads#622final)
and [5.0.5.Final](/downloads#505final). These are both bug fix releases.

RESTEasy [6.2.2.Final](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/3363) targets 
[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/). Full release notes for this 
release can be found [here](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/6.2.2.Final). This will be the current 
version integrated into [WildFly](https://wildfly.org).

RESTEasy [5.0.5.Final](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/3362) targets 
[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 2.1](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/2.1/). Full release notes for this 
release can be found [here](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/5.0.5.Final). Only critical or blocking 
bug fixes will end up in the 5.x releases in the future.

Moving forward 6.3 will become the upstream version. In the 6.3 releases we hope to have some integration with 
[gRPC](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-2656). Also, better integration for some 
[default formatting](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3264).

As always, [feedback](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/) is welcome. Stay safe, and, depending on where 
you are, stay warm or be cool.

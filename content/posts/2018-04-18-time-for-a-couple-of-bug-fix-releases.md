Two months after last round of releases, here we are again with _two_ _**RESTEasy**_ _bug fix versions_, 4.0.0.Beta3 and [3.5.1.Final](https://resteasy.jboss.org/downloads).

After we completed the implementation of **JAX-RS 2.1** and shipped it few months ago within [WildFly](https://wildfly.org/) 12, we started getting some feedback about it. I&#39;m really happy about the interest coming from the community, thanks and please keep on playing with RESTEasy ;-) Anyway, thanks to users contributions and some additional internal testing, we&#39;ve fixed a bunch of issues especially around **JSON-B** support and **SSE**.

On top of that, with **JDK 10** having been officially released, we had to ensure that the project can be successfully built and tested with it. So if you&#39;re running with Java 10, upgrading to RESTEasy 3.5.1.Final / 4.0.0.Beta3 is really something you should evaluate.

The full release notes are available [here](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12336861&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=12310560&amp;Create=Create). The Maven artifacts are availableÂ  for both releases on the usual repository.

Next round of releases will most likely include few new and interesting features, stay tuned... ;-)

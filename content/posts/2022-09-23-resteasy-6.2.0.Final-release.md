We are happy to announce the release of [RESTEasy 6.2.0.Final](/downloads#final) and 
[RESTEasy MicroProfile 2.0.0.Final](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-microprofile/releases/tag/2.0.0.Final). Both
of these will end up in the up and coming [WildFly 27](https://wildfly.org) release.

#### RESTEasy 6.2.0.Final

As mentioned in a [previous post]({% post_url 2022-09-08-resteasy-6.2.0.Beta1-release %}) the following two major
changes are the reason for a 6.2.0.Final instead of 6.1.1.Final:

1. [RESTEASY-3085](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3085) - Upgrade Jackson to 2.13
2. [RESTEASY-3075](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3075) - Implement the `EntityPart.withName()`

There have also been some other bug fixes and component upgrades. The full release notes are available [here](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/releases/tag/6.2.0.Final).

Feel free to join in the [discussion](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/3281) about the release.


#### RESTEasy MicroProfile 2.0.0.Final

This is the first final release which targets the [Eclipse MicroProfile 5.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/5.0).
This version of the Eclipse MicroProfile targets Jakarta EE 9.1.

The release is mostly focused on the namespace change from `javax` to `jakarta`. This is the biggest change along with
requiring Java 11 at runtime. One of the reasons for this is the SmallRye implementations also require Java 11. The
other reason is, it's probably time to move to Java 11 &#128512;.

Again, feel free to join in the [discussion](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-microprofile/discussions/115) about 
the release.

#### Future of RESTEasy

As we continue to move forward with RESTEasy, 6.2 and 5.0 will be the currently maintained versions. The 6.1.x and 
older versions will longer be maintained.

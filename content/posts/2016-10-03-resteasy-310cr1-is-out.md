Just a note to tell you that [the first CR](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12331470&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=12310560) version of RESTEasy 3.1 has been [tagged](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/tree/3.1.0.CR1) last Friday. The artifacts are available on the [Maven repository](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/jboss/resteasy/).

It&#39;s still a good time to have a look at and try the new 3.1, any feedback is welcome. We hope to go Final by the end of this month :-)

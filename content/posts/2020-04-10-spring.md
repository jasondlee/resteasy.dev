In this blog I'd like to demonstrate the process to deploy the `resteasy-spring-basic` example project into WildFly Servlet-Only Distribution.

The example can be fetched from here:

* [resteasy-examples/resteasy-spring-basic at master · resteasy/resteasy-examples · GitHub](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-examples/tree/master/resteasy-spring-basic)

You can clone the example project and do the package of the example by running the Maven command:

```bash
$ pwd
resteasy-examples/resteasy-spring-basic
```

```bash
$ mvn package
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

After packaging is done we can get a WAR file:

```bash
$ ls target/*.war
target/resteasy-spring-example-basic.war
```

We will use this war to deploy to the WildFly server later.

The next step is to download the WildFly, and here is the download link:

* [Downloads · WildFly](https://wildfly.org/downloads/)

In the download page, you can find the `Servlet-Only Distribution`. And Click the `ZIP` format to download it.

For the time I'm writing this blog, the `19.0.0.Final` is the latest version, so I downloaded the `wildfly-servlet-19.0.0.Final.zip` from the page.

After the zip is downloaded, I extract it to my work directory:

```bash
$ cd wildfly-servlet-19.0.0.Final
```

And then I entered the `bin` directory for the server:

```bash
$ cd bin
```

Then I run the WildFly in standalone mode:

```bash
$ ./standalone.sh
...
14:49:27,801 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0025: WildFly Servlet 19.0.0.Final (WildFly Core 11.0.0.Final) started in 1772ms - Started 138 of 142 services (40 services are lazy, passive or on-demand)
```

From above we can see the server is started. Then I opened another terminal window and enter the `bin` directory again:

```bash
$ pwd
wildfly-servlet-19.0.0.Final/bin
```

Then I run the `jboss-cli.sh` in the directory and use it to connect to the server:

```bash
$ ./jboss-cli.sh
connect You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server or 'help' for the list of supported commands.
[disconnected /] connect localhost
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]
```

As the text shown above it connected to the WildFly server. Then I deployed the WAR file into the server with following command:

```bash
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] deploy resteasy-examples/resteasy-spring-basic/target/resteasy-spring-example-basic.war
```

After running the above command, the server outputs the log:

```txt
14:50:34,459 INFO  [org.wildfly.extension.undertow] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 47) WFLYUT0021: Registered web context: '/resteasy-spring-example-basic' for server 'default-server'
14:50:34,496 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 1) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "resteasy-spring-example-basic.war" (runtime-name : "resteasy-spring-example-basic.war")
```

As the log shows the project is deployed. Now we can try to access the service:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/resteasy-spring-example-basic/rest/foo/hello
Hello, world!
```

As the output shown above we can see the service can be accessed.

Just few days after CR1, here we are again with [another candidate release](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/tree/3.1.0.CR2) version of RESTEasy 3.1.0. A couple of regressions (actually compared to 3.1.0.Beta1) have been spotted and fixed and we&#39;ve gone through a bunch of dependencies upgrades. Full release notes available [here](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12331750&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=12310560&p;Create=Create).

The new artifacts are available on the Maven repository as usual; please keep on trying the latest bits and report any issue you find, thanks a lot! Final release is coming soon :-)

Cheers

Alessio

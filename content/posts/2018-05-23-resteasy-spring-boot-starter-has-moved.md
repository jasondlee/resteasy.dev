Back in August last year, [Fabio Carvalho](https://developer.jboss.org/people/fabiocarvalho) from PayPal has blogged here on [how to use RESTEasy in a Spring Boot application](https://developer.jboss.org/community/resteasy/blog/2017/08/09/how-to-use-resteasy-in-a-spring-boot-application), relying on a Spring Boot starter project that he basically developed. What happened in the following months is that PayPal decided to donate the project to Red Hat.

So here I am today, 
publicly thanking Fabio and PayPal and announcing the first final release of the rebranded RESTEasy Spring Boot starter
.

The new project sources are on GitHub under the [RESTEasy organization](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot); the issue tracker is [the same](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RESTEASY?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&amp;status=released-unreleased) as the main RESTEasy project and previously existing issues have been migrated there.

Compared to the latest release from PayPal repository, the first Red Hat release, [1.0.0.Final](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot/tree/1.0.0.Final), brings an update to Spring Boot 1.5.12.RELEASE version and explicit support for Java 9 &amp; 10.

In the next future, the plan is to move forward embracing Spring Boot 2 and integrating more recent versions of the core RESTEasy (3.5 / 3.6 streams).

_So please stay tuned, play with the latest release and feel free to contribute!_

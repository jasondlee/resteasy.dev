It's been about a month since the initial [5.0.0 release]({% post_url 2021-11-04-resteasy-5.0.0-release %}) and now is
the time for some updates. Today [5.0.1.Final](/downloads#501final) was released along with 
[4.7.4.Final](/downloads#474final). These are both bug fix releases.

Along with the two bug fix releases comes [RESTEasy 6.0.0.Beta1](/downloads#600beta1). This is the
first official [Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.0/) for RESTEasy. As
previously stated there is no plan for new features in 6.0.0. This is simply the same as 5.0.0 with the `jakarta`
namespace change.

As always if you try these new releases and find bugs please file a [JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY).

A couple of months ago, we [announced](https://developer.jboss.org/community/resteasy/blog/2018/05/23/resteasy-spring-boot-starter-has-moved) the move of the **RESTEasy Spring Boot starter** to [RESTEasy organization on GitHub](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot). We also mentioned that soon a new version of the starter would have been available... and here we are today, presenting [release 2.0.0.Final](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot/tree/2.0.0.Final), which

*   integrates **Spring Boot 2** (currently 2.0.3.RELEASE version)
*   relies on the latest RESTEasy 3.x series (currently _3.6.0.Final_ version).

The artifacts are available on Maven central repository, as well as the JBoss repository. 
Feel free to pull them and give them a try.


Enjoy!

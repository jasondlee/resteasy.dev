It&#39;s been a busy week... but before leaving for the week-end I owe you an update ;-) Three new releases have been completed in the last days:

*   [RESTEasy 3.6.1.Final](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310560&amp;version=12337962), first maintenance release of the 3.6 series, will be shipped in next WildFly 14;
*   [RESTEasy 4.0.0.Beta5](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12337963&amp;projectId=12310560), latest step towards RESTEasy 4, cleans up a bunch of deprecated / old classes;
*   [resteasy-spring-boot-starter 2.0.1.Final](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12338799&amp;projectId=12310560), upgrades to latest RESTEasy core and Spring Boot (2.0.4.RELEASE).

As usual, give them a try while they&#39;re hot, feedback is welcome!

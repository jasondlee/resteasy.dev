Yesterday we pushed a new couple of releases (3.1.2.Final and 3.0.22.Final) out of the door, so have a look at the release notes and [try them](http://resteasy.jboss.org/downloads) :-)

The new versions are mainly bug fix ones. Something interesting is that we started testing against JDK 9. RESTEasy 3.1.2.Final contains some changes / fixes and workarounds to allow building the project with the current latest early access version of JDK 9. The testsuite is also mostly passing.

As usual, any feedback or issue... just let us know!

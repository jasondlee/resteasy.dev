Today we'd like to announce the release of RESTEasy [6.2.12.Final](/downloads#6212final) and RESTEasy
[7.0.0.Beta1](/downloads#700beta1).

## 7.0.0.Beta1

RESTEasy 7.0.0.Beta1 is a [Jakarta REST 4.0](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/4.0/) implementation. This is the first beta release, a long time coming
if I'm being honest. There have been high hopes we could get more features into this release, but the time has come
to start finalizing it as Jakarta EE 11 becomes finalized.

### Bugs:

* [RESTEASY-3491](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3491) - Unable to find netty dependency with missing  ${os.detected.name}-${os.detected.arch} parameters
* [RESTEASY-3495](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3495) - problems when filename have accent
* [RESTEASY-3553](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3553) - \[CVE-2024-9622] HTTP smuggling requests cause timeouts in resteasy-netty
* [RESTEASY-3562](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3562) - Regression in writing empty multipart content
* [RESTEASY-3577](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3577) - Multipart Form requests do not work correctly when the @FormParam type is not an EntityPart
* [RESTEASY-3582](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3582) - SeBootstrap services crash on shutdown

### Enhancements:

* [RESTEASY-3583](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3583) - resteasy-undertow-cdi needs a mechanism to configure the Undertow builder more

## New `UndertowBuilderConfigurator` API

In [RESTEASY-3583](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-3583) we introduce a new 
`dev.resteasy.embedded.server.UndertowBuilderConfigurator` interface which allows you to configure a 
`io.undertow.Undertow.Builder` before the Undertow server is started.

With this new interface, you can configure the `io.undertow.Undertow.Builder` with one or more configurators. You
simply need to implement the interface as a service provider. You can optionally use the `jakarta.annotation.Priority` 
on the implementation where the lowest priority runs first.

## Finally

As always, [feedback](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/discussions/) is welcome. Stay safe, and, depending on where you are, stay warm or be cool.

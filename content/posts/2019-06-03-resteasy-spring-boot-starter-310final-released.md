RESTEasy Spring Boot Starter 3.1.0.Final is released and can be fetched from Github:

*   [Release 3.1.0.Final · resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot · GitHub](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot/releases/tag/3.1.0.Final)

Here is the maven dependency section to include the new release in your project:

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.resteasy</groupId>
   <artifactId>resteasy-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
   <version>3.1.0.Final</version>
   <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

The change in this release is that it adopts _RESTEasy 3.7.0.Final_ as dependency.

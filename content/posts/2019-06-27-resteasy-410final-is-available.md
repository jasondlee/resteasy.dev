Folks,

as previously anticipated, **RESTEasy 4.1.0**.Final **has been released!** It brings the new **MicroProfile REST Client 1.3** implementation on 4.x series too, the same provided last week with 3.8.0.Final.

Besides that, few other new features and improvements are included in this release; something worth mentioning is that the community contributed two new modules for integration with the [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) , namely a new implementation of the _Async client engine_ interface based on [Reactor Netty](https://projectreactor.io/docs/netty/release/reference/index.html) and initial support for _Flux_ and Mono types in resources, similarly to what RESTEasy already does with _RxJava 2_ types.


While 3.8.0.Final is soon landing in [WildFly](https://wildfly.org/) and [Thorntail](https://thorntail.io/), the upgrade to 4.1.0.Final has just been merged in Quarkus master, so the new version will most likely be part of next [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) release!

_Stay tuned and give the new versions a try!_

_Thanks!_

Just before Halloween, here is another nice release of **RESTEasy**!

The [new version](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310560&amp;version=12342767&amp;styleName=Text) comes with:

*   a bunch of new features in the Spring Web integration area
*   many enhancements, mainly aiming at improving performances
*   a lot of component upgrades, to pull in the latest / greatest available dependencies
*   some important bug fixes (including one for a potential memory leak in the Reactor Netty client integration)
 
In addition to that, **RESTEasy 4.4.0.Final** is the first version relying directly or indirectly on **Jakarta EE** API artifacts. We&#39;ve been replacing all JavaEE API dependencies with the corresponding Jakarta EE 8 ones, while moving to new major versions of JBoss spec API artifacts (now forked from Jakarta EE APIs). This basically followed the same approach we used in [WildFly](https://wildfly.org/) (read more from Brian [here](https://wildfly.org/news/2019/10/03/WildFly18-Final-Released/#alignment), if interested).
 
The 4.4.0.Final release artifacts are available on Maven Central and JBoss Nexus repositories as usual and the distribution can also be downloaded at [https://resteasy.github.io/](https://resteasy.github.io/). 

Finally, [Quarkus 0.27 has just been released](https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-0-27-0-released/) too, and it includes RESTEasy 4.4.0.Final... time to give it a try ;-)

Feedback is welcome as usual!

Enjoy!

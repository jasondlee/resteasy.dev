**RESTEasy 3.1.4.Final** and **3.0.24.Final** have been released during last weekend. They&#39;re both maintenance releases, including a bunch of bug fixes. Please have a look at the [release notes](https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310560&amp;version=12334711&amp;styleName=Text&amp;Create=Create) for details.

Now it&#39;s really time for the team to focus on implementing **JSR 370 (JAX-RS 2.1)**, which will be one of the features marking next minor (or major, maybe) of RESTEasy.

Stay tuned!
